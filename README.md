### Project and Repositury context
![image](https://github.com/Ndukulele/CMPG323_Overview_34641068/assets/90989283/e52ce139-f1f5-4b3a-8765-db369a977a88)

A .gitignore will be created for each project so that unneccessary files can be ignored and not affect the main work .
This helps to keep the repository to look less messy and easier to analyse.

### Storage of credentials and sensitive information

All important certifications and badges will be immediately posted on important accounts like LinkedIn for future oportunities. Passwords for each account will be unique from each other. 

### Branch

Branching will be made for each project to keep unexpected errors from affecting the project. While progress is made on each project over time it will be updated periodically to optimise productivity an effeciency.Hence why there is a period of preparation to make sure that all resources are available before starting on each project and to make sure that I understand what is required from me.
For every time progress is made a pull request will be made.
